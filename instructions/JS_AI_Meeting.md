Summary
MCP Personal Project Review
A review of personal skill development demonstrated successful
integration of the Microservice Communication Protocol (MCP) into a pet
project, utilizing a JSON schema for validation and highlighting MCP's
speed and efficiency.
JS Department Strategy Planning
The JavaScript department plans to leverage this expertise to build a
systematic approach for knowledge sharing, focusing on identifying skill
gaps and setting up MCP as a service for future industry needs.
Architecture and Security Focus
While MCP implementation is straightforward, the critical challenges lie in
architecture, system design, security, orchestration, and integrating MCP
into wider AI workflows as a middle layer for tools and LLMs.

NEEDS FURTHER DISCUSSION
System Design Development Standard
Architecture, system design, security, observability must be standard focus for
development, not just basic MCP implementation. Group must consider governance,
security, and monitoring complexity when developing MCP services.
ALIGNED
Schedule MCP Demo Meeting
Separate meeting scheduled to showcase Hernan's existing code base and MCP setup,
including specific integrations like Jira and chat. Demo must highlight development
complexity and setup time for better knowledge transfer. Ivan will arrange next week's
time slot.
More details:
● Experience with MCP and Personal Projects: Hernan Humana shared their
experience with MCP (Microservice Communication Protocol), noting they
reviewed the official documentation available since November and focused on
core functionalities, fundamentals, and architecture, including limitations. Their
experience includes integrating MCP successfully into a pet project where they
set up two servers connected via cloud chat, allowing them to import prompts
and use the MCPs for code or server generation, utilizing a JSON schema for
validation (00:00:00). Maksym Ushchenko clarified that this work was completed
as a personal pet project to develop their skills, not as part of a commercial client
product (00:04:17).
● Personal Skill Development and Future Plans: Hernan Humana confirmed that
their work on MCP and related technologies, including system design and SCP
authentication with plans to incorporate OpenAD to manage API keys, is part of
their self-driven skill development (00:04:17). They also mentioned focusing on
Amazon Web Service certifications and already completing 14 hours across five
modules, with plans to start a 45-hour module focused on designing products
from a business perspective (00:05:20). They emphasized that their personal
experience suggests MCP will become a necessity for customers soon,
highlighting its speed and efficiency in solving past technical bottlenecks, such
as those related to audio transcription models (00:09:33).
● JavaScript Department Initiative and Knowledge Gap: Maksym Ushchenko
explained that the current goal is to build a plan for the JavaScript department by
understanding current capabilities and capacities, noting that they are trying to
find opportunities for the department and leverage Hernan Humana's experience
(00:06:31). Hernan Humana, who is part of the advocate community but has had
limited participation, noted they have many ideas, including the possibility of
incorporating MCP server development into the Personal Development Plan
(PDP) as a future necessity for the industry (00:09:33). Maksym Ushchenko
stressed that the goal is to identify the gap in knowledge and establish a
systematic approach within the JavaScript department to share knowledge and
set up MCP as a service (00:15:44).
● The Importance of System Design and Architecture: Hernan Humana asserted
that while implementing MCP can be straightforward with documentation, the
most important aspects remain architecture, system design, orchestration,
security, and observability (00:12:50). Maksym Ushchenko agreed, adding that
developing new MCP servers from scratch, setting up governance and security,
and integrating MCP into wider AI workflows as a middle layer between Large
Language Models (LLMs) and tools adds significant complexity beyond just
reading documentation. They also highlighted the need to consider security
measures like prompt injection validation, which involves utilizing MCP gateways
to log records, do profiling, and block unnecessary requests (00:14:15).
● Scheduling a Follow-up Demonstration Meeting: Maksym Ushchenko proposed
a separate meeting to showcase Hernan Humana's work, including the code base
and integration of MCP with tools like Jira and chat, suggesting this would
provide a clearer understanding for other participants (00:11:46). Hernan
Humana agreed to the demo, expressing they would like details on what is
expected and confirming they would be available the following week as they are
taking a holiday this week (00:17:19). Ivan Husiev concluded that the next step is
for them to find a suitable time slot for the demonstration meeting and notify
Hernan Humana (00:18:56).
Suggested next steps
Hernan Humana will prepare a demo for next week to showcase the setup of
code with MCP, Jira, and chat, highlighting the complexity and integration details.
Maksym Ushchenko and Ivan Husiev will find a time slot that fits all participants
for the demo meeting with Hernan Humana.
